This angular project is built with Angular, utilizing a clean and structured architecture. It features guards for authentication, ensuring that users are redirected to the login page if they donâ€™t have a valid token. The project also includes interceptors that automatically attach the token to HTTP requests, allowing seamless authentication with the backend. Services are created to interact with the APIs via HTTP calls, and models and interfaces are used throughout the project to ensure the use of typed data. The project is styled with Tailwind CSS and Angular Material, providing a responsive and modern user interface. It follows a modular structure, where each page has its own folder containing /components, /models, /pages, and /services to keep the codebase organized, legible, and maintainable. Additionally, there is a /shared folder that contains reusable components, models, and services that are used across multiple pages. The login interface uses a default username and password for authentication, and once logged in, users can access other routes protected by the authentication guard. The token is saved in cookies and is automatically included in the HTTP requests through the interceptor.
